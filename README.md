#Testing practice with Jest

Playing around with testing javascript through jest.  This is an [Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/home) assignment.  Unless you followed the link from the [assignment](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/javascript/lessons/testing-practice?ref=lnav) itself, there's probably nothing here of interest.  Feel free to look though.
